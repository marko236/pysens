PySens is a simple, command-line program written in Python(both 2.x and 3.x can run the CLI, but only 3.x can run the GUI).
It was made because the 'sensors' command shows sensor-detected temperatures only once, while PySens CLI uses a WHILE loop.
It uses built-in shell(bash/zsh/other) and package lm-sensors. It can be ran on most of
the linux distros(any that have lm-sensors preinstalled or installable(ex. Mint, Fedora,
Ubuntu, Puppy...)), but not on native Windows(you have SpeedFan for that).
Currently, there are no known bugs or issues(because, well, it's 6-34 lines long).
3.9.2021 - PySens has a GUI now(using tkinter so usually no need to install anything).
11.6.2022 - Version 1.1 released. Added options to adjust refresh rate and show/hide prevoius outputs
